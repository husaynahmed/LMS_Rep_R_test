##The Course

This course introduces R and statistical programming as well as best practices for reproducible research using R's dynamic reporting and version capture tools.

The course consists of 3 sections, 2 on basic R and 1 on reproducibility in R.  
Each section is presented as both HTMl and Rpres markdown ( to allow for intergration of the presentation in the RStudion enviroment itself).  Exercises and answer sheets are included after all subsections to practice techniques and provide future reference examples. 

Course material and exercises are available to view as rendered HTML at http://mrccsc.github.io/Reproducible-R/.  
All material is available to download under GPL v2 license.
